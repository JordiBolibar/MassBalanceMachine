# MassBalanceMachine Core

In the ```mbm``` folder, the core code of MassBalanceMachine can be found. The code is divided into partitions; each process step has dedicated scripts, which can be found in folders with their respective names. Each folder has a README file explaining each script, the order in which the scripts should be executed, and the script's output. Depending on the dataset, all or only some scripts are useful to new users. Inspiration can be taken from other regions, already available in this repository in the folder ```regions```, for more extended data (pre)processing. The core of the MassBalanceMachine, currently consists of: 

- ```scripts-data-processing```, please read the README file for more information on the available scripts. 

**Note**: please be aware that all scripts should be run manually, each with its input and output file. The location of these files should be adjusted to your environment, desired location, and file names.

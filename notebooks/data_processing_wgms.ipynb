This example will guide you through the data processing pipeline, which retrieves topographical and meteorological features for all points with glaciological surface mass balance observations.\n",

Next, we specify the location where we will store the files for the region of interest (in this case, Norway). The data used in this example is from the [WGMS database](https://wgms.ch/data_databaseversions/), and we will utilize the specified columns.\n",

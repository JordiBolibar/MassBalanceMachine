    "# MassBalanceMachine Data Processing - Example for Retrieving Training Features for the Iceland Region (Custom Data)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will illustrate the data processing workflow of the MassBalanceMachine using an example involving glaciological data from Icelandic glaciers. This example will walk you through the process of converting your data so that it is in the WGMS format. Once your data is in the correct format, one can follow the data processing example [notebook](https://github.com/ODINN-SciML/MassBalanceMachine/blob/main/notebooks/data_processing_wgms.ipynb) specifically for WGMS(-like) data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is intended for users who do not currently have their data in the WGMS format or whose data records are not yet associated with a single measurement. Specifically, we are working with stake measurements from Icelandic glaciers. Each record in our dataset includes three dates and three measurements for a single hydrological year. Our goal is to reformat this dataset so that each of these single data records is split into three separate data records, each corresponding to one of the recorded stake measurements within the hydrological year.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we will import necessary libraries, including the `massbalancemachine` library. Following this, we will define the storage location for files related to our region of interest, which in this case is Iceland. The data used in this demonstration is sourced from the [Icelandic Glaciers Inventory](https://icelandicglaciers.is/index.html#/page/map), provided by the Icelandic Meteorological Office.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stake measurements for the Icelandic glaciers have already been retrieved via an API call and merged into a single file. The script for these processes can be found in the following directory: `regions/iceland/scripts/data_processing`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** We strive to accommodate various data formats, but occasionally, users may need to make adjustments to ensure compatibility. For assistance, users can refer to the WGMS documentation, providing a detailed guidance on formatting requirements. The documentation, from the WGMS 2023 database, can be found under in the following directory: `example_data/wgms_documentation.md`. This ensures that your data integrates seamlessly into the MassBalanceMachine workflow. "
